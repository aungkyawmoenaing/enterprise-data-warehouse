# Enterprise Data Warehouse Project

This project demonstrates how to build a **SQL Data Warehouse from scratch** using a real-world data engineering approach.

The project focuses on:
- Data warehouse schema design
- Loading raw data into staging tables
- Transforming data using SQL
- Creating analytics-ready tables

---

## Project Structure

```

.
├── datasets/        # Raw source data (CSV files)
├── documents/       # Architecture diagrams and documentation
├── scripts/         # SQL scripts for ETL / ELT
├── tests/           # Data validation and test queries
├── .gitignore
└── README.md

```

## Key Concepts

- Data warehouse design
- ETL / ELT using SQL
- Bronze → Silver → Gold layers
- Analytics-ready data models

---

## How to Use

1. Place raw CSV files in the `datasets/` folder  
2. Run SQL scripts from the `scripts/` folder in order  
3. Query final tables for analysis and reporting  

---

## Notes

- Raw data is kept separate from transformed data
- SQL scripts are version-controlled
- This project is intended for learning and practice
